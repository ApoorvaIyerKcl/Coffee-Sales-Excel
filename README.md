# BrewVista Coffee Co. 

**Executive Summary**

Sales performance is critical for retail businesses in the food and beverage industry, where purchasing behaviour is influenced by time, location, and customer preferences. This project analyses transactional sales data from **BrewVista Coffee Co.** to evaluate product performance, demand patterns, time-based trends, and location-level sales behaviour.
The analysis was conducted using **Microsoft Excel**, where the dataset was cleaned, structured, and analysed through pivot tables and interactive dashboards. The final output enables stakeholders to explore sales performance dynamically and supports more informed decisions related to operations, planning, and resource allocation.

**Business Problem**

Although the coffee shop collects detailed transaction-level data, the raw dataset does not directly support decision-making. Business stakeholders face challenges in answering key questions related to performance and demand, including:
1. Which products and categories drive the majority of sales revenue
2. How customer demand changes by day, month, and season
3. Which store locations are performing better than others
4. When peak sales hours occur during the day
5. How customer preferences vary by product size and season

**Methodology**

The project followed a systematic Excel-based approach to convert raw data into actionable insights:
1. Examined the dataset to understand available attributes and measures
2. Cleaned and standardised data to ensure consistency and accuracy
3. Built pivot tables to summarise sales data across key business dimensions
4. Created charts aligned with specific analytical questions
5. Implemented slicers to allow interactive filtering and exploration

**Skills**

1. Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and structuring, Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, Slicers and business-focused data visualisation
2. Analytical Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers, Translating data into actionable insights
3. Business Skills: Stakeholder-oriented analysis, Performance tracking and reporting, Insight-driven recommendations

**Results & Business Recommendations**

The dashboard provides management with clear visibility into sales performance across products, time periods, and locations. Key insights include:

2. Sales volume and revenue fluctuate by day of the week and time of day, indicating clear peak periods
3. Demand varies noticeably across seasons, with changes in preference for certain product sizes
4. Some store locations consistently outperform others in both sales volume and revenue

**Based on these insights, the following actions are recommended:**

1. Focus inventory and promotional efforts on high-performing products
2. Adjust staffing schedules to align with peak demand periods
3. Plan seasonal offerings and campaigns based on demand patterns
4. Assess underperforming locations to identify improvement opportunities

**Next Steps**

With additional time and data, the analysis could be extended in the following ways:
Incorporate cost data to evaluate profitability in greater detail
Analyse customer behaviour to identify repeat purchasing patterns
